                <h1>Who we are</h1>
                <p>Over forty years ago, ALIS had its start as Insurance Partners, Inc., a life and health brokerage
                    firm to support local property and casualty agents. From those humble beginnings in the middle of
                    the Pacific, the firm was rebranded in 2015 as Advanced Legacy & Investment Solutions to reflect the
                    global scope of services now offered by the firm. ALIS now oversees half a billion in in-force
                    coverage and $150 million in premiums and assets under management.
